        The draft code is the culmination of five years of planning and analysis to help meet the community’s housing needs, including thousands of community touchpoints and inputs along the way:

        1. The [2019 Community Housing Needs Assessment](https://www.bozeman.net/departments/economic-development/community-housing/community-housing-action-plan/community-housing-needs-assessment) identified a need for 5,600 additional dwelling units by 2025 stated, plainly, that "_more housing and more diversity in housing is needed._"
        2. The [2020 Community Plan](https://bozeman-community-plan-1-bozeman.hub.arcgis.com) recommends to, “_Promote housing diversity, including missing-middle housing;” “increase required minimum densities in residential neighborhoods;_” and, to "_complete the transition to a form-based code._"
        3. The [2020 Community Housing Action Plan](https://www.bozeman.net/departments/economic-development/community-housing/community-housing-action-plan) identified unzoning a priority strategy.
        4. The [2021 UDC Affordable Housing Assessment](https://www.bozeman.net/home/showpublisheddocument/12096/637871809455388253) notes that, with “_little developable land available, any effort to increase the quantity of housing available while decreasing cost will have to allow increased residential density in the existing zoning districts through infill and redevelopment._” The plan recommends to “_establish a more detailed menu of multi-household building classifications, such as small (up to 6 units), medium (6-18 units), and large (18 units and over)_,” and that, “_Bozeman move to eliminate the lot-area-per-dwelling-unit regulations_.”
        5. The draft code has been under development for more than a year with [press coverage](https://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/city/bozeman-releases-draft-of-development-code-rewrite/article_36e68ee6-474f-11ee-bfaf-3feb89b61e16.html) and [numerous public engagement opportunities](https://engage.bozeman.net/16906/widgets/55265/documents/44995).

  - title: The draft code allows 8 (or 24) units to be built next door.
    content: |
        Due to the form-based lot and building limitations, you’d need a large lot (or tiny units) to create an 8-unit building in R-A or a 24-unit building in R-B. In general, building eight units (of at least 600 SF each), is dimensionally impossible on lots less than 7,500 SF and is improbable under a more realistic set of assumptions (a bedroom-count maximizing mix of average size one- and two-bedroom units) on lots less than 11,000 SF.

  - title: The new code will unleash a flurry of teardowns of existing functional and affordable housing
    content: |
        The significant majority of parcels in Bozeman’s existing multifamily zones (even in areas zoned R-4) remain single-family residences because scraping existing functional housing is extremely expensive. “Scrapes” in residential areas (downtown is different) typically only happen a) for a future owner-occupant who isn’t trying to make a profit; or b) when the remaining economic value of a structure is close to zero. The draft code does not improve the economics of scraping functional housing for new construction.
        
        Where we are likely to see new development activity as a result of this code change is in newly legalized backyard additions and internal divisions (e.g. creation of basement apartments), and subdivision of existing large lots—all of which will produce new housing units at a much lower price point than scraping existing functioning housing.
  - title: The new code will unleash a feeding frenzy of development
    content: |
        Unfortunately for pro-housing advocates, any uptick in development activity is likely to be modest at best. For any increase in development activity to occur there must be a) a business case that is profitable under the new code that wouldn’t be allowable or profitable under the current code; b) an increase in the number of willing sellers; and, 3) a developer with an interest in doing one-off infill projects. 
    
        On this last point, [Strong Towns notes that](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2023/4/26/upzoning-might-not-lower-housing-costs-do-it-anyway), “_the kind of infill builder who builds small apartment buildings on single residential lots is almost an extinct species in many cities. Large development companies buy up whole city blocks to build 5-over-1 apartment buildings, or they create new subdivisions in the suburbs. They are largely not interested in one-off, small-scale infill projects. You can change your zoning code to legalize such projects, but who is going to build them?_”
  - title: Any new inventory will just become empty vacation homes or short-term rentals
    content: Investor-owned short-term rentals are already banned in all residential areas (and the Bozeman’s rules and enforcement are getting stricter) and owner-occupancy rates in Bozeman are actually trending upward. I used Montana Cadastral data in in March 2019 to determine that 61.7% of Bozeman’s residential parcels were owner occupied (a parcel is assumed to be owner-occupied if the tax bill mailing address is the same as the street address).  I measured again in September 2022 and found that this number had actually increased to 62.4%. Downtown developments may differ (and that's not a bad thing—see the [Yuppy Fishtank](https://southernurbanism.org/blog/in-defense-of-yuppie-fishbowls) thesis), but rates of owner-occupancy in Bozeman's residential neighborhoods are actually increasing.
  - title: The types of buildings allowed by the Draft UDC are incompatible with historic norms
    content: |
        In reality, Bozeman’s historic neighborhoods (which predate modern Euclidean zoning) are chock full of small apartments, internally subdivided houses, fourplexes, five-plexes, and even higher density 24- to 50-unit apartment buildings. [This map](https://maps.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?webmap=6fcc977947ae43d0adfc81c6edbb1b9b) (screenshot below) illustrates this diversity of housing types (consistent with the R-A category) in the historic neighborhoods south of Main Street.
        
        ![diversity of houses in historic neighborhoods](/img/compare_historic_neighborhoods.png)
        
        The Bon Ton Historic District contains many "Missing Middle" type structures, such as the building shown below, which is internally subdivided into five apartments. Under current zoning rules, if this structure burned down, whatever replaced it could only be the home for one household.

We are in support of adopting Bozeman's [Draft UDC](http://engage.bozeman.net/udc){:target="_blank"} which would re-legalize Missing Middle type houses. 

## Bozeman Needs Housing Reform

1. **Everybody can agree that the housing status quo in Bozeman is unacceptable.** It's a status quo of displacement, McMansionization, and runaway housing prices. And it's because of the current zoning code. 

2. **Teachers and firefighters and frontline service workers need homes here.** Under the zoning status quo, we are becoming a city where the essential workers we depend on cannot afford to live here. Do we want to be a city where our children have no teachers, our fire department has no firefighters or our stores and restaurants have no workers because they can't afford housing here?

3. **We all have a role to play in solving our housing shortage.** No neighborhood should bear the entire brunt of new development but no neighborhood should be walled off from new housing either.

4. **We need to re-legalize our favorite "Missing Middle" housing options in Bozeman.** Just about every historic neighborhood in Bozeman has a beloved fourplex or sixplex that's illegal to build under today's zoning code. That's a big part of our problem. We need to relegalize those homes so we can have more of them.

## Common Draft UDC Misconceptions

Unfortunately, the city's lack of proactive communication about the draft code has created a lot of misinformation.
